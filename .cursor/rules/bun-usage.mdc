# Bun Runtime and Package Manager

This project uses **Bun** as its JavaScript runtime and package manager. All scripts, dependencies, and tooling are designed to work with Bun.

## Why Bun?

- **Fast**: Significantly faster than Node.js and npm
- **TypeScript Support**: Native TypeScript execution without compilation
- **Package Manager**: Drop-in replacement for npm with faster installs
- **Bundler**: Built-in bundling and transpilation
- **Test Runner**: Native test runner with Jest-like syntax

## Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
bun install

# Run scripts
bun run <script>

# Run tests
bun test

# Execute files directly
bun run <file>

# Add dependencies
bun add <package>
```

## Important Notes

- **Do not use `npm` or `yarn`** - this project is configured specifically for Bun
- **Package.json** specifies `"packageManager": "bun@1.0.0"` to enforce Bun usage
- All build scripts and tooling expect Bun's runtime environment
- TypeScript files (`.ts`) are executed directly by Bun without compilation step

## Development Workflow

1. Use `bun install` instead of `npm install`
2. Use `bun run build` instead of `npm run build`
3. Use `bun test` instead of `npm test`
4. For direct execution: `bun run file.js` or `bun -e "code"`

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:
1. Ensure you're using Bun version 1.0.0 or later
2. Run `bun install` to ensure dependencies are properly installed
3. Check that you're not accidentally using `npm` or `node` commands
